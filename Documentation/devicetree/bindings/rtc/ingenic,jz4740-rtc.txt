JZ4740 and similar SoCs real-time clock driver

Required properties:

- compatible: One of:
  - "ingenic,jz4740-rtc" - for use with the JZ4740 SoC
  - "ingenic,jz4770-rtc" - for use with the JZ4770 SoC
- reg: Address range of rtc register set
- interrupts: IRQ number for the alarm interrupt
- interrupt-parent: phandle of the interrupt controller

Example:

rtc@10003000 {
	compatible = "ingenic,jz4740-rtc";
	reg = <0x10003000 0x3F>;

	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <32>;
};
